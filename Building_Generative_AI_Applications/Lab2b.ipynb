    "## Overview\n",
    "When we work with large documents, we can face some challenges as the input text might not fit into the model context length, or the model hallucinates with large documents, or, out of memory errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve those problems, we are going to show an architecture that is based on the concept of chunking and chaining prompts. This architecture is leveraging [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) which is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/42-text-summarization-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A large document (or a giant file appending small ones) is loaded\n",
    "1. Langchain utility is used to split it into multiple smaller chunks (chunking)\n",
    "1. First chunk is sent to the model; Model returns the corresponding summary\n",
    "1. Langchain gets next chunk and appends it to the returned summary and sends the combined text as a new request to the model; the process repeats until all chunks are processed\n",
    "1. In the end, you have final summary based on entire content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case\n",
    "This approach can be used to summarize call transcripts, meetings transcripts, books, articles, blog posts, and other relevant content."
